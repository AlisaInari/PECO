# PECO - Provenance of Emission Calculations Ontology <img src="Logo PECO.svg" width=30/>

With the Net Zero agenda gaining significant traction across the world, organisations are often required to report carbon emissions associated with their operation. However, calculating emissions is not a trivial task and reported scores can differ depending on the choices made by those performing the calculations or the software used to assist with this task.

This repository contains the files and rationale for the Provenance of Emission Calculations Ontology, an ontology designed to make emission calculations transparent to users by extending the PROV standard.

## Getting Started

This ontology is available at [https://w3id.org/peco#](https://w3id.org/peco#) with content negotiation in RDF/XML, TTL, JSON-LD and N-Triples.

To download the ontology in different serializations, you can use a curl command like:

```
curl -sH "Accept:text/turtle" -L https://w3id.org/peco#
```

To see the documentation of the ontology, just open its URI on a browser.

## Versioning

PECO uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
All ontology releases have their own URI.
For example, version 0.0.1 is available at [https://w3id/peco/0.0.1](https://w3id.org/peco/0.0.1):

[https://w3id.org/peco#](https://w3id.org/peco#) redirects to the last available version.
