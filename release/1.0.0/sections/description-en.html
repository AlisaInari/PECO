  An emission score is generted by an emission generation activity, which participates in an peco:emissionObservation. To clarify how this works in reality, the following example shows a real execution trace
  from the <a href="https://calculator.linkeddata.es/">Semantic Machine Learning Calculator</a>, which estimates carbon emissions for Machine Learning models:

<p>The image shows the execution trace of the calculator in the middle, while all the machine-readable trace is explained in the legend</p>
